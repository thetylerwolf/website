# Contact

I'm currently available for select consulting engagements, particularly those involving backend architecture, infrastructure strategy, or technical leadership during transitions.

For inquiries about consulting work, or to discuss potential collaboration, the best way to reach me is via email.

I typically respond within one to two business days. For urgent matters, please indicate as such in the subject line.
