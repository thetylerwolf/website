# Your Name

Senior Engineer

I build backend systems, infrastructure, and technical architecture for organizations navigating complexity. Currently available for select consulting engagements.

## Profile

Over fifteen years, I've worked across early-stage startups, growth companies, and established enterprises—building systems that scale, leading technical teams, and translating ambiguous business requirements into reliable software.

My work tends toward backend systems, data infrastructure, and platform architecture. I'm most useful in situations that require deep technical judgment, ownership of ambiguous problems, and the ability to work effectively across engineering, product, and executive stakeholders.

I value calm, deliberate work. I prefer depth to breadth, and I'm skeptical of technical decisions driven by novelty rather than necessity.

## What I'm typically brought in to do

- Own and architect backend systems with significant complexity or scale requirements
- Lead technical strategy for teams navigating growth transitions
- Untangle legacy systems and establish paths toward sustainable architecture
- Bridge gaps between technical teams and business stakeholders
- Provide technical due diligence for acquisitions or investments
- Mentor senior engineers stepping into architectural or leadership roles
