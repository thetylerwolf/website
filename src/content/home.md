# Tyler Wolf

Senior Backend / Platform Engineer

I work on backend systems and infrastructure where reliability, long-term operation, and technical direction matter.

Focused on systems designed to operate reliably over time.

## Profile

Over the past 15 years, I’ve worked with complex software systems across early-stage startups, growing companies, and established enterprises. My work focuses on backend systems and infrastructure where long-term reliability, correctness, and maintainability are central concerns.

I work comfortably with a wide range of stakeholders, from engineering teams to C-level leadership, and with inputs that range from detailed specifications to loosely defined product visions. In practice, this often means taking ambiguity seriously and carrying it through to concrete, dependable systems.

The work I do is foundational by nature. I value calm, deliberate progress, depth over breadth, and technical decisions driven by necessity rather than novelty. Much of my focus is on building systems that remain stable and comprehensible well beyond the initial implementation.

## What I'm typically brought in to do

- Take ownership of backend systems with meaningful complexity or scale, from early design through long-term operation
- Stabilize and evolve existing systems, improving reliability, scalability, and operational clarity
- Untangle legacy architectures and technical debt, establishing clear paths toward more sustainable systems
- Provide technical leadership across teams, owning architectural direction and guiding long-term technical and operational decisions
